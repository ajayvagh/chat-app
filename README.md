- Group and one-on-one chat support
- Responsive UI

## Tech Stack
### Frontend (SC Frontend)
- React.js (with React Router DOM for navigation)
- CSS (for styling)
- Axios (for API calls)
- Socket.io-client (for real-time communication)

### Backend (CD Backend)
- Node.js with Express.js
- MongoDB (Database)
- Mongoose (ODM for MongoDB)
- Socket.io (for real-time communication)
- bcrypt (for password hashing)
- JWT (for authentication)

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- MongoDB (Local or Cloud - MongoDB Atlas)
